<h1>Dom Richichi</h1>

<p>Hey, I’m Dom Richichi.</p>

<p>I’m a multidisciplinary graphic designer, with a bachelors degree in art history and theory. My experience involves work for local record labels (King Empire Records), non-profit organizations (Causeway and United Way Centraide Canada), as well as print and production work (Ottawa Print Services).

I believe in solving problems with creative flair and efficiency. I strive to tell stories through in-depth research and concept development.</p>

My main competencies revolve around Illustration, branding, motion graphics, and user interface design.</p>

Looking for a designer to work on some awesome upcoming projects?  Interested in talking graphic design or in collaborating? Let’s chat!
